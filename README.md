This repository contains data and code underpinning analysis of a survey conducted among California households about appliance purchasing and rebate behavior.
The data and code here, particularly the R Markdown script, will reproduce the numbers in Sherwin et al. 2021 associated with the survey.
The analysis presented in the same paper related to household energy consumption relies on a proprietary dataset that cannot be shared due to an existing non-disclosure agreement.
